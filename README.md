# Directed Weighted Graph and Algorithms

This program is an implementation of a directed weighted graphs written in C programing.
The program also implements algorithms which can be applied on the graph.

## Features
- Create, add and remove vertices.
- Create, add and remove edges.
- Build a directed weighted graph.
- Run algorithms on a directed weighted graph.

#### Algo.c
This class features the following functions:
- *insert_node_cmd* : Add new vertex to the graph. 
- *delete_node_cmd* : Delete a certian vertex from the graph.
- *shortsPath_cmd* : Returns the length of the shortest path between 2 vertices, using [Dijkstra's algorithm.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) 
- *TSP_cmd* : Computes a list of consecutive nodes which go over all the nodes in cities.
- *build_graph_cmd* : Build a graph with user's inputto the consule.
